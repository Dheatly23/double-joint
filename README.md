# Double Joint

An algorithm to create nice-looking Minecraft shoulders (and legs)

## Introduction

This repository contains documentation and implementation of Double Joint.
Included is the original IPython notebook that i created in 2019.

## Background

Back then, i really **don't** like the look of Minecraft animations.
Especially in the shoulders and legs, **every** one of them will clip.
So, with my high-school knowledge of trigonometry, Python, and 3D,
i cobbled together the notebook.

In 2022, i now have Git(hub) and a will to release this to everyone.
I know alone i can't implement this to every 3D software.
So perhaps with it, we can put this algorithm into people's hand.

## How it Works

See the notebook or SPEC.md (coming soon)

## License

Unless otherwise noted, all code is licensed with Apache-2.0. You may
reimplement the algorithm from scratch (not covered by copyright),
but if you copy any part of the code, you **MUST** comply to the license.
What you **MAY NOT** do is to patent the algorithm. Since my country
does not recognize software patents, neither i nor you may patent any part
of the algorithm.
