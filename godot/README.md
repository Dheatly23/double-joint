# Godot Example

This folder contains an implementation of Double Joint in Godot.
Open it with Godot 4. There is a default skin for testing, which
you can edit it with your own skin.

## How to Embed

If you want to use it in your own project, copy the model folder.
The model scene has a skeleton which you can bind to and manipulate.
Because of limitations, **only** rotate joint bones, don't move the endpoint.
