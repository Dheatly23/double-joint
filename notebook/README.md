# The Original Notebook

This folder contains the original notebook. It is used as the reference
implementation and documentation source. All outputs has been removed
for security reasons.

Also included is a test skin, used for testing.

Requires the following libraries:
- `ipywidgets`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pillow`

To use it, just run it with Jupyter Notebooks. I recommend installing Anaconda,
or WinPython if you're on Windows.
